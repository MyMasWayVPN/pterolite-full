# PteroLite Container Path Restriction - COMPLETED âœ…

## Task Summary
Fixed file manager and console to restrict container access to their specific folders only.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Backend Changes (server.js)
- [x] Added `validateContainerPath()` function for path validation
- [x] Updated all file manager endpoints to use path validation:
  - [x] `/files` - List files with container restriction
  - [x] `/files/content` - Read file content with validation
  - [x] `/files/save` - Save file with path restriction
  - [x] `/files/upload` - Upload file with validation
  - [x] `/files/extract` - Extract ZIP with path restriction
  - [x] `/files` (DELETE) - Delete file with validation
  - [x] `/files/mkdir` - Create directory with validation
- [x] Added proper error handling for 403 Forbidden responses
- [x] Container path format: `/tmp/pterolite-containers/{containerName}`
- [x] Default path for non-container access: `/tmp/pterolite-files`

### Frontend Changes (FileManager.jsx)
- [x] Added container parameter to all API calls
- [x] Updated `fetchFiles()` to send container name
- [x] Updated `openFile()` with container validation
- [x] Updated `saveFile()` with container parameter
- [x] Updated `deleteFile()` with container validation
- [x] Updated `uploadFileHandler()` with container parameter
- [x] Updated `createFolder()` function with validation
- [x] Enhanced `goUp()` function with container boundary checks
- [x] Added container info display in UI
- [x] Added access restriction warning message
- [x] Added "New Folder" button functionality
- [x] Improved error handling for 403 responses

### Frontend Changes (Console.jsx)
- [x] Removed working directory input field
- [x] Added `getContainerName()` function to extract container name
- [x] Added `getContainerWorkingDir()` function for automatic path determination
- [x] Updated `handleExecuteCommand()` to use container working directory
- [x] Updated `handleRunPersistentCommand()` to use container working directory
- [x] Added container info display in console UI
- [x] Added working directory display with lock icon
- [x] Added working directory info to command output
- [x] Commands now automatically execute in container folder only

### Security Features
- [x] Path traversal protection using `path.resolve()`
- [x] Container boundary enforcement
- [x] Proper error messages for access violations
- [x] Visual indicators for restricted access
- [x] Console commands restricted to container folders
- [x] No manual working directory modification allowed

## ðŸ”’ Security Implementation

### Path Validation Logic:
1. **Container Mode**: When container is selected
   - Base folder: `/tmp/pterolite-containers/{containerName}`
   - All paths must be within this folder
   - Cannot access parent directories outside container folder

2. **Default Mode**: When no container selected
   - Base folder: `/tmp/pterolite-files`
   - Standard file access within default directory

3. **Protection Methods**:
   - `path.resolve()` to prevent `../` traversal attacks
   - `startsWith()` validation for container boundaries
   - Server-side validation on all file operations
   - Client-side boundary checks for better UX

## ðŸŽ¯ Result
- âœ… Each container now has isolated file access
- âœ… Container `awewe` can only access `/tmp/pterolite-containers/awewe/`
- âœ… Cannot access `/tmp/pterolite-containers/` or other containers
- âœ… Console commands execute only in container folder
- âœ… Working directory input removed from console
- âœ… Proper error handling and user feedback
- âœ… Enhanced UI with container information display
- âœ… Security against path traversal attacks

## ðŸ“‹ Example Usage:

### File Manager:
- Container "awewe" â†’ File access limited to `/tmp/pterolite-containers/awewe/`
- Container "test" â†’ File access limited to `/tmp/pterolite-containers/test/`
- No container â†’ File access to `/tmp/pterolite-files/`

### Console:
- Container "awewe" â†’ Commands execute in `/tmp/pterolite-containers/awewe/`
- Container "test" â†’ Commands execute in `/tmp/pterolite-containers/test/`
- No container â†’ Commands execute in `/tmp/pterolite-files/`

Both file manager and console now properly enforce container isolation as requested! ðŸŽ‰
