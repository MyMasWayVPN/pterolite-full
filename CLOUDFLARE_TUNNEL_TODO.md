# Cloudflare Tunnel Feature Implementation

## Progress Tracker

### 1. Backend Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] Create TunnelManager class for managing tunnel processes
- [x] Add tunnel endpoints:
  - [x] GET /tunnels - List all active tunnels
  - [x] POST /tunnels/create - Create named tunnel
  - [x] POST /tunnels/quick - Create quick tunnel
  - [x] GET /tunnels/:id/logs - Get tunnel logs
  - [x] POST /tunnels/:id/stop - Stop tunnel
  - [x] DELETE /tunnels/:id - Remove tunnel
  - [x] POST /tunnels/install-cloudflared - Install cloudflared
  - [x] GET /tunnels/check-cloudflared - Check if cloudflared is installed
- [x] Add tunnel process management with logging
- [x] Add tunnel status tracking (running, stopped, error)

### 2. Frontend Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] Add tunnel API functions to api.js:
  - [x] getTunnels()
  - [x] createTunnel()
  - [x] createQuickTunnel()
  - [x] getTunnelLogs()
  - [x] stopTunnel()
  - [x] removeTunnel()
  - [x] installCloudflared()
  - [x] checkCloudflared()
- [x] Create TunnelManager component with features:
  - [x] Cloudflared installation check and installer
  - [x] Create tunnel form (Quick vs Named)
  - [x] Active tunnels list with status indicators
  - [x] Tunnel logs viewer
  - [x] Tunnel management (start, stop, remove)
  - [x] Help section with usage instructions
- [x] Add TunnelManager to App.jsx navigation
- [x] Add "CF Tunnels" tab with tunnel icon üåê

### 3. Installation Script Updates ‚úÖ
- [x] Add install_cloudflared() function
- [x] Support multiple architectures (amd64, arm64)
- [x] Add cloudflared installation to main installation flow
- [x] Add error handling for cloudflared installation

### 4. Features Implemented ‚úÖ

#### Tunnel Types:
- **Quick Tunnel**: Temporary tunnel with random URL (no auth required)
- **Named Tunnel**: Persistent tunnel with custom subdomain (requires CF account)

#### Management Features:
- **Auto-detection**: Checks if cloudflared is installed
- **One-click installer**: Installs cloudflared if not present
- **Real-time logs**: View tunnel output and extract public URLs
- **Status tracking**: Monitor tunnel status (running, stopped, error)
- **Process management**: Start, stop, and remove tunnels

#### UI Features:
- **Installation wizard**: Guides users through cloudflared setup
- **Tunnel creation form**: Easy tunnel configuration
- **Active tunnels dashboard**: Overview of all running tunnels
- **Logs viewer**: Real-time tunnel logs with URL extraction
- **Help documentation**: Built-in usage instructions

### 5. Testing & Verification ‚ùå
- [ ] Test cloudflared installation on different architectures
- [ ] Test quick tunnel creation and URL extraction
- [ ] Test named tunnel creation (requires CF account)
- [ ] Test tunnel logs and status updates
- [ ] Test tunnel stop/start functionality
- [ ] Test tunnel removal and cleanup
- [ ] Verify tunnel URL extraction from logs
- [ ] Test error handling for failed tunnels

## Current Status: Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

## How Cloudflare Tunnels Work:

### Quick Tunnels:
1. User specifies local port (e.g., 3000)
2. System runs: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000`
3. Cloudflare provides random public URL (e.g., https://abc123.trycloudflare.com)
4. URL is extracted from tunnel logs and displayed to user

### Named Tunnels:
1. User specifies port, name, and subdomain
2. System runs: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000 --name custom-subdomain`
3. Requires Cloudflare account authentication
4. Provides persistent subdomain

## Integration Points:

### Backend Integration:
- Tunnels are managed alongside other processes
- Tunnel logs are captured and stored
- Status updates are tracked in real-time
- API endpoints follow existing authentication patterns

### Frontend Integration:
- TunnelManager component follows existing UI patterns
- Integrated into main navigation tabs
- Uses existing API client infrastructure
- Consistent with other management interfaces

## Security Considerations:
- Tunnels expose local services to the internet
- Quick tunnels are temporary and auto-expire
- Named tunnels require Cloudflare authentication
- Tunnel URLs are logged for user access
- Process isolation prevents tunnel interference

## Use Cases:
1. **Development**: Expose local dev servers for testing
2. **Demos**: Share work-in-progress with clients
3. **Webhooks**: Receive webhooks on local development
4. **Remote Access**: Access applications from anywhere
5. **Testing**: Test applications with external services

## Next Steps for Testing:
1. **Install PteroLite** with new tunnel features
2. **Test cloudflared installation** on target system
3. **Create quick tunnels** for various ports
4. **Verify URL extraction** from tunnel logs
5. **Test tunnel management** (stop, start, remove)
6. **Document any issues** found during testing
